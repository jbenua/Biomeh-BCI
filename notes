notes:

battery
________
if we set a filter like 0.2 Hz, there is a possibility,
that we never get a packet with data about battery.
Maybe i should make a button - 

press ->
in a coro poll_interval is set to a 200Hz, for example ->
wait for battery to update ->
poll_interval is set back ->
end of coro
